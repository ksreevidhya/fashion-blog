        <h2>The Craft Map of Sabyasachi (and What It Taught Me)</h2>
        
        <p>Studying Sabyasachi opened my eyes to how one designer can unite multiple craft regions under a single aesthetic identity.</p>

        <h3>A. Weaving Traditions That Built His Textiles</h3>
        <h4>1. Benarasi Silk Weaving</h4>
        <p>His bridal couture often uses Kadhua weaving, where motifs are inserted individually into the loom. When I read how a single brocade panel can take days to weave, I finally understood what craftsmanship truly means. The butidar zari work adds ceremonial weight to his lehengas while still carrying a handmade warmth.</p>
        <h4>2. Khadi from Bengal</h4>
        <img class="img2" src="c1.jpg" alt="Image placeholder">
        <p>Khadi is not just a fabric; it’s a political and cultural textile. When I touched khadi samples during class, I recognised the same irregular textures that Sabyasachi highlights in his blouses, sari borders, and menswear kurtas. He treats khadi’s imperfections as beauty—something that changed the way I personally see textiles.</p>
        <h4>3. Tussar & Matka Silk</h4>
        <p>These silks have a tactile, grainy character. By observing them, I understood why Sabyasachi prefers them—they hold embroidery beautifully and drape with quiet dignity. They taught me how fabric fall influences silhouette and craftsmanship.</p>
        <p>⸻</p>
        <h3>B. Embroidery Narratives I Learned to Read</h3>
        <h4>1. Zardozi</h4>
        <p>Before studying his work, zardozi felt like “just heavy bridal work.” But <br>Sabyasachi’s muted, antique gold zardozi—often couched by<br> hand—made me recognise how surface ornamentation can <br>communicate age, royalty, and intimacy.</p>
        <h4>2. Aari & Resham</h4>
        <p>His fine aari needlework forms Mughal-inspired trellises and floral vines.<br> When I practised aari in class, I realised how much precision goes<br> into the evenness of the stitches. The designer’s use of matte resham <br>threads taught me how thread sheen can change the mood of a<br> garment.</p>
        <h4>3. Gota Patti & Parsi Gara</h4>
        <p>His lighter festive lines use gota appliqué from Rajasthan, while his elite saris feature Parsi Gara satin-stitch florals. Understanding these helped me map how one designer balances regional identities within one cohesive collection.</p>

        <h3>C. Dyeing & Printing Techniques</h3>
        <p>Learning about Bagru and Sanganeri block printing gave me<br> a clearer understanding of natural dye absorbency and<br> block alignment. Sabyasachi often uses these prints in<br> resort wear, tying everyday craft to luxury branding. He also <br>introduces Bandhej tie-dye to create saturated, festive<br> palettes—a reminder that colour psychology is as culturally <br>specific as it is aesthetic.</p>
