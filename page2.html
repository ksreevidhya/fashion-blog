        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>When I started studying fashion, I believed design was mostly about silhouettes, trends, and colours. But the more I explored Indian fashion, the more I realised that our industry stands on something much deeper—craftsmanship. And if there is one designer who made me truly understand the soul of Indian craft, it is Sabyasachi Mukherjee.</p>

        <p>This blog is not just research—it is a reflection of what I learned while studying his work: how handloom textiles, heritage embroideries, and slow fashion can shape an entire luxury brand. Understanding his design philosophy helped me appreciate the time, skill, and humanity behind every handmade garment.</p>
