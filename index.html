        <h2>Craft Overview: India’s Living Handmade Heritage</h2>
        <img class="img1" src="o1.jpg" alt="Image placeholder 1">  
        <p>India’s craft ecosystem is a vast, interconnected network of artisans who preserve knowledge that has been passed down for generations. Whether it is the shimmer of zardozi, the delicate geometry of gota-patti, the hand-spun texture of khadi, or the opulence of Benarasi brocades, each craft carries the weight of regional history and identity.</p>
        <img class="img2" src="o3.jpg" alt="Image placeholder 2">  
        <p>In my own learning as a fashion student, I realised that crafts are more than just surface decoration—they are slow processes built on time, labour, and cultural memory. While reading The Fabric of India (V&A Museum, 2015) and industry reports (FICCI, 2019), I understood how much of Indian fashion is rooted in these handcrafted traditions. Every motif, every thread count, every stitch technique represents communities, livelihoods, and local aesthetics.</p>

        <p>This awareness helped me appreciate how designers engage with artisans, and it shaped why I chose to study Sabyasachi Mukherjee, a designer whose couture is inseparable from India’s craft heritage. His work does not simply “use” craft; it revives, repositions, and reveres it. Beginning the blog with this overview allows his design philosophy to be seen within the larger ecosystem of crafts, clusters, and artisan knowledge.</p>
