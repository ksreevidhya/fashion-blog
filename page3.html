        <h2>Background: The Designer Who Turned Nostalgia Into Luxury</h2>
        <p>Sabyasachi began his label in 1999, but his style feels older than any trend cycle. His design voice comes from a place of memory—sepia-toned Bengal homes, vintage jewellery, fading zari borders, old family saris, and the texture of handwoven fabrics.</p>

        <p>What fascinated me most while studying him was how confidently he rejected mass-produced glamour. He built his world using:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Handwoven khadi with its earthy grain</li>
            <li>Benarasi brocade with kadhua butidar motifs</li>
            <li>Rust-gold zardozi with an antique patina</li>
            <li>Tussar silk with a matte, organic texture</li>
            <li>Aari and resham embroidery forming delicate floral jaals</li>
        </ul>

        <p>While researching these techniques, I realised they’re not just embellishments<br>—they represent hours, hands, and heritage. It made me rethink how much value lies behind a single stitch.</p>
