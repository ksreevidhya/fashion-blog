        <h2>Consumer Segments: Understanding the Market Through His Work</h2>
        
        <p>Studying his audience helped me understand real consumer psychology:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Brides seeking heirloom couture</li>
            <li>High-net-worth collectors who value textiles</li>
            <li>NRIs wanting authentic cultural luxury</li>
            <li>Gen Z inspired by his digital storytelling</li>
            <li>Men choosing khadi bandhgalas and brocade sherwanis</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It showed me that craft adapts beautifully across income levels, aspirations, and lifestyle segments.</p>
        <p>⸻</p>
        <h2>Conclusion: My Personal Takeaway</h2>
        
        <p>This research changed the way I understand fashion. Sabyasachi’s work taught me that design isn’t only about trends—it’s about respect for craft, patience in process, and the emotions woven into handmade textiles.</p>
        <p>Through this study, I learned to see the beauty in handloom irregularities, the discipline in zardozi precision, the stories inside block prints, and the humanity behind every artisan’s touch.</p>
        <p>Most importantly, I realised that Indian luxury is not about extravagance—it is about heritage, time, and craftsmanship. And as a fashion student, that is a lesson I will carry into everything I create.</p>
